# Kubernetes Monitoring Setup with Grafana and Prometheus

Welcome to the documentation for setting up a comprehensive monitoring system for your Kubernetes environment using Grafana and Prometheus. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring, deploying, and managing the monitoring stack to gain valuable insights into the health and performance of your Kubernetes clusters and applications.

**Why Monitoring Matters**

Monitoring is a crucial aspect of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of your applications and infrastructure. In a dynamic and containerized environment like Kubernetes, understanding the behavior of your applications and clusters is essential for effective resource utilization, troubleshooting, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Key Benefits of Monitoring:**

1. Proactive Issue Detection: Identify and address potential issues before they impact your users.
2. Performance Optimization: Optimize resource utilization and improve the overall performance of your applications.
3. Capacity Planning: Plan for future growth by analyzing historical trends and patterns.
4. Troubleshooting: Quickly diagnose and resolve issues with real-time insights into your Kubernetes environment.

**Pre-Requisite:**
* Virtual Machine
* Minikube
* Kubectl
* Helm

**Tools Used in This Setup:**

In this monitoring setup, we leverage two powerful tools:

**Prometheus:** An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. Prometheus excels at collecting and querying metrics from your Kubernetes infrastructure.

**Prometheus Architecture:**

**Grafana:** A popular open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana integrates seamlessly with Prometheus, providing a feature-rich dashboarding and visualization experience.

**Minikube** It is used for local Kubernetes cluster setup. It sets up a single-node Kubernetes cluster within a virtual machine (VM) or a container, allowing developers to experiment, develop, and test their applications in a Kubernetes environment without the need for a full-scale cluster.

**Kubectl:** It is the command-line interface for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

**Helm:** It is a package manager for Kubernetes applications, facilitating the deployment and management of complex applications using Helm charts.
